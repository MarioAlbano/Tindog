# Under development

Hello! This is the **TinDog** web site. 

I made this project based on the udemy course by teacher Angela Yu. In it I learned the first steps on how to use CSS to manipulate containers and images, z-index, basics of color and typography design and how to use bootstrap. I intend to implement it with JavaScript in the future and customize it more.

Feel free to contact me. Thanks for your visit!
